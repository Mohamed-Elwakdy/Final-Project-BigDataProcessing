### Introduction About The Dataset 

In this project, the APDM’s advanced wearable sensors, Opalsand Mobility Lab have been used to collect, analyze, and store outcome measures.Attach sensors to the subjects and instruct them to perform a standardizedtest. This process takes less than five minutes and the number of sensors is 3or 6.The used dataset contains many h5 files that can be openedusing Python. There are many variables that are used in this dataset.  Each file in this dataset contains variablesabout somebody who is walking or standing.Here, I worked on one nested data structure h5 file whichcontains the features of one walking person. Walking corridor must be at least7 meters in length. The data size of the features is not the same. This is an example of nested data structure where the numberof rows is 113 rows:

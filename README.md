### Introduction About The Dataset 


In this project, the APDMâ€™s advanced wearable sensors, Opalsand Mobility Lab have been used to collect, analyze, and store outcome measures. This process takes less than five minutes and the number of sensors is 3 or 6.

The used dataset contains many h5 files that can be openedusing Python. There are many variables that are used in this dataset.  Each file in this dataset contains variables about somebody who is walking or standing.

Here, I worked on one nested data structure h5 file which contains the features of one walking person. Walking corridor must be at least7 meters in length. The data size of each independent variable (feature) is not the same. 

This is an example of nested data structure where the number of rows is 113 rows: 

Events/Gait/Lower Limb/All Steps Left 

Events/Gait/Lower Limb/All Steps Right 
 
Events/Gait/Lower Limb/Cycle Validity with Heel Strike Times
